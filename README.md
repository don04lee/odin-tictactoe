# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my recreation of the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game following the Odin Project. The main purpose of this project was to rely on module patterns and factory functions, as well as making as little global variables as possible in the JS. 

The main difficulties with this project was trying to understand how factory functions were supposed to work, as they seemed confusing at first. I had originally attempted to make a separate player factory function, but it seemed redundant and useless. As a result, I ended up just using two modules, which are the game's board and game's controller. 

Additions I'd like to make is a Tic-Tac-Toe AI which was hinted with the utility of the minmax function, which would eternally lead to a draw (in theory). In addition, I'd like to add a title screen that would allow players to choose the player vs player or player vs bot option, but I'd like to incorporate the title screen only after I had learned transitions that would allow me to transition from a title screen and into a normal tic-tac-toe grid.
